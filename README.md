# Luna Multiplayer - Linux Server Management Scripts
The **Linux Server Management scripts** aim to provide a full management tool set for a **Luna Multiplayer server**. They allow to manage most aspects of the server

  * Installing and updating mod
  * Creating/editing/deleting server instances (including editing the serverconfig through a commandline interface)
  * List all instances with basic information or show detailed information on a single instance
  * Starting/stopping instances including graceful shutdown if the server has not hung up
  * Backup of game data files (instance configurations, logs, saves)

This wiki will guide you through the setup and usage of the tool set.
